<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created as my fourth and final project at General Assembly for the Software Engineering Immersive Program. 

The idea is for language learners to be able to connect with native speakers of the language they would like to learn so that they may be able to practice and enhance their language skills.

Oletta is intended to be a mobile application, but for the purpose of this project only (with a deadline of 1 week), it was built using React to showcase how it would work when it is made as the real application.

**This project is *not* meant to be viewed on larger screens, it is designed for devices with a viewport of width 428px and height 926px only.**

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This section will cover the flow of the app and the way it's meant to be used.

* Users will be able to sign up for a new account and will be logged into their account automatically.
* New users who have just signed up will be redirected to account setup, where they will be able to select their native languages & up to 3 other languages that they're interested in learning. These settings will affect the 'matching' algorithm.
* After account setup or if a user logs in, they are directed to the main page of the app where they can see 'user cards'. Here is where they will be able to swipe right or left (or vote yes or no) in order to match with users.
* If two users have both swiped right on each other, they will both get a notification letting them know that they have a new match.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Next Steps

* Fix the matching algorithm so that users can actually match with each other instead of just voting yes or no
* Fix the bug that is when users swipe till the end of the 'user cards', it should not restart and reshow all the users
* Add messaging features
* Add user profile view
* Recreate the app in React Native so that it actually works on mobile (this project was simply to present the app features and idea)

#### Other general features to be added:
* Users will be able to chat with each other and also form communities
* Users will be able to post updates (sort of like social media) of their language learning journey
